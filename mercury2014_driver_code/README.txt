The two example folders contain code in two different languages that can be used as a reference for creating
the driver's program for the 2015 competition. The Python example is the code we used for the driver in 2014.
The java example was not used for Mercury, but it provides an example of using an Xbox controller for robot
control in java.

The actual_code folder is where the code for the 2015 competition will be kept. Please make all edits in
the actual_code folder, not in the example folders. The example folders are only to be used for reference.
